Pihole/adguard lists for FamilyLink

Pulled together from @rifting 's domain list and my own logging. 

# Installation
---
Add https://github.com/l-a-u-g-h-i-n-g/familylink-pihole/raw/refs/heads/main/familylink.txt to your DNS server's blocklists. For nextDNS, you must add each domain manually. 

# Bark (WIP, can't guarentee functionality)
Add https://github.com/l-a-u-g-h-i-n-g/familylink-pihole/raw/refs/heads/main/bark.txt to your DNS server's blocklists. For nextDNS, you must add each domain manually. 

# Requests?
Give a list of domains that you know about, the name of the service, and info about it and I can try to make it work. Bonus points if you can open a PR with edits to the readme.md for documentation and a adguard formatted txt file for the known domains.
